Spring and MicroServices
-------------------------

Program: Program is a set of instructions which performs a specific tastk.
Component: A reusable program is called a component.
Service: A resuable component which is exposed over the network is called service.

Micro Service

Macro Service : When microservices are assembled together we will get
macro service.

Application Types:
1. Monolithic --- Is written by maintaing JEE standards
2. MicroService --- when we use Java EE we can achevie 40% reusability.
Then shifted towards microservices.

springboot is purely designed for microservices which supports 80% resuability.

FAST API is another technology given by python can also be used to create MS
HELIDON also used to create MS
SpringBoot using Kotlin also used to create MS
NodeJS and ExpessJS also uses to create MS
NextJS also used to create MS
also LoopBack.Js also used to create MS

Top Most 4 MS frameworks are:
1. Springboot with java
2. Helidon
3. FAST API
4. NodeJS and ExpressJS

MS are tightly coupled to with DevOps and 12 factors approach

PODMan is substitute for Docker

container is collection of components
